          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup salted butter softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup light brown sugar packed</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>2 cups chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate chunks)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. 
                Line a baking pan with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cream together butter and sugars until combined.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy.</li>
            <li>Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.</li>
            <li>Add 12 oz package of chocolate chips and mix well.</li>
            <li>Roll 2-3 TBS (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into 
                balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets. (alternately, use a 
                small cookie scoop to make your cookies).</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just 
                BARELY starting to turn brown.</li>
            <li>Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.</li>
          </ol>

            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p>Recipe information calculated based on this recipe making 36 cookies – 2 TBS of dough a piece)</p>
            <p>When you remove the cookies from the oven they will still look doughy. THIS is the secret that makes these 
                cookies so absolutely amazing! Please, I beg you, do NOT over bake!</p>

              <summary>Ingredient Substitutions</summary>
              <li> <strong>Butter.</strong> I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend 
                tasting the dough to ensure that it’s salted to your liking. </li>
                <li><strong>White Sugar.</strong> You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown sugar.</strong> I use light brown sugar in this recipe for the best results.</li>
                <li><strong>Flour.</strong> I recommend using an unbleached, all-purpose flour to make these chocolate chip 
                    cookies. Many readers have used gluten-free all-purpose flour with excellent results. </li>
                <li><strong>Sea Salt.</strong> I exclusively bake and cook with pure, fine sea salt. Sea salt is different 
                    than table salt (that is iodized), so if you use salt other than sea salt I recommend 
                    testing the recipe first with 1/2 tsp and then adjusting to your taste.</li>
                <li><strong>Chocolate Chips.</strong> As you can see from the photos, sometimes I use chocolate chunks, 
                    chopped chocolate, or chocolate chips. It doesn’t matter what you use, as long as you use 2 cups.</li>
