                    I recently learned of a new way to make unbelievably delicious brownies and the secret.... Dr. Pepper. Yes, the soda! 
                    Come along with me on this journey of chocolatey bliss.

                <p>
                    This recipe comes from a viral video, so if you've already seen it a thousand times, my apologies. Let's dive right in.
                </p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>
                    For this recipe, we will be keeping things as simple as possible, so while it may be even better to create the 
                    brownie mix from scratch, we will be using a store bought brownie mix (any mix should do the job).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-made brownie mix - 1 bag</li>
                    <li>Eggs - 2</li>
                    <li>Vegetable Oil - 1/2 cup</li>
                    <li>Chocoalte Chips - Add as desired if not included in the mix</li>
                    <li>Dr. Pepper - 1/4 cup</li>
                    <li>Softened Butter</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees</li>
                    <li>Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl (brownie mix and chocolate chips)</li>
                    <li>Add eggs, vegetable oil, and Dr. Pepper to the dry mix</li>
                    <li>Mix and fold ingredients together using a spatula (or optionally an electric mixer if you have it)</li>
                    <li>Get a 9x9 inch glass baking dish and coat the inside with the softened butter</li>
                    <li>Pour your brownie mix into the dish</li>
                    <li>Once the oven reaches 350 degrees, place the dish in the oven and bake for 20 minutes</li>
                    <li>Take the brownies out of the oven after 20 minutes and test the consistency with a toothpick. \
                        The toothpick should not pick up any crumbs when stuck into the center of the brownies and removed.</li>
                    <li>Let the brownies cool for a few minutes and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And there you have it. A delicious recipe for easy to make brownies when you need a little sweet treatment!</p>

                <h3>Alterations</h3>
                <p>If you are lactose sensitive like I am, you can substitue the butter for a baking spray like Pam, or line the baking dish
                    with parchment paper before putting it in the oven.
