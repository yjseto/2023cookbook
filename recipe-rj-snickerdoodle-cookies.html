                <p>Fun Fact: The snickerdoodle has been called many names, including "Cry Babies," "Jumbles" and "Plunkets." In the early 1900s,
                there was a popular folk character named Snickerdoodle who was the subject of many tall tales. It's claimed that the
                cookie might have been named after this fanciful folk hero.</p>

                <p>
                    Snickerdoodles are characterized by a cracked surface and can be either crisp or soft depending on the ingredients used.
                    They are often referred to as "sugar cookies". However, traditional sugar cookies are often rolled in white
                    sugar whereas snickerdoodles are rolled in a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon. Cream of tartar is added for its
                    signature texture as another main difference.
                </p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 c. (360 g.) all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 tsp. cream of tartar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                    <li>3/4 tsp. baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 c. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 c. (300 g.) granulated sugar, divided</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp. ground cinnamon</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Follow these four simple steps and you will have delicious cookies in no time!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, cream of tartar, salt, and baking soda until combined. In a large bowl, using a handheld
                    mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend
                    after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Add dry ingredients and beat on low speed until just combined. Cover and
                    refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. In a small bowl, whisk cinnamon and remaining 1/4 cup sugar.</li>
                    <li>Using a medium cookie scoop (about 2 tablespoons), scoop dough and roll into balls. Toss balls in cinnamon sugar and
                    arrange on prepared sheets, spacing 2" apart.</li>
                    <li>Bake cookies until puffed and edges are just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to
                    a wire rack and let cool completely.
</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>If not prepared properly, snickerdoodles have a habit of going flat. Almost all snickerdoodle recipes call for baking
                soda rather than baking powder. Baking soda can lose its effectiveness if it sits on the shelf for too long. Always use
                fresh baking soda to ensure your snickerdoodles will maintain their trademark fluffiness. The cream of tartar should be
                fresh, as well.</p>

                        "This chocolate snickerdoodle recipe is similar to a basic snickerdoodle recipe but some of the flour is replaced with
                        cocoa powder," explains recipe creator rhancox. With the combination of cocoa and cinnamon, the flavors are akin to
                        Mexican hot chocolate.

                        Recipe creator Melodie describes these cookies as "Fast, easy, tasty, and sweet with a kick of spice." Using pre-made
                        chai concentrate means these are a cinch to make and each bite is infused with the heady flavors of chai spices.
